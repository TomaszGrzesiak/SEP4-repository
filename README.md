# SEP4: Mushrooms paradise üçÑ
In short, the project is to develop 3 tier system to support and manage production of mushrooms.

Mushrooms need a proper humidity, temperature, CO2 and light levels in order to grow efficiently on a farm.

The project is to develop:
* An IoT device/devices that contain all the sensors and manage other devices to keep the proper conditions,
* A database and datawarehouse in a cloud, that helps to analyse the data and to mediate between IoT devices and an Android app,
* An Android app to manage the IoT device, view and analyse the data.
 
# Story line behind the project.

Akihiro and Daisuke are two Japanese shiitake farmers that grow organic mushrooms. Nowadays, they have to keep track of temperature, humidity, co2 levels and remember to turn off the lights when leaving the premises because, at some stages, the mushrooms need to grow in obscurity.

The business is growing, and they plan to triplicate the production, but with the available personnel, it is impossible to keep track of all the data. For that reason, Organic Mushroom Farmers A/S has contacted us to develop a global solution for the farm.

Temperature sensors will keep track of the temperatures, turning off the heaters when reaching a certain level. CO2 sensors will store the data, and RC-servo will activate air circulation. Humidity sensors will help start the air humidifiers when needed, and a light sensor, together with PIR, will turn off the lights when nobody is working there. All of this is managed remotely from an Android app.

That way, they will be able to escalate the production with the same personnel, multiplying the profits.
